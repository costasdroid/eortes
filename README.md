A simple android application using a local database

#### Expalining

This is my first attempt to the world of both android and github.
The present android app, is using a preinstalled database containing names and dates.
Then from one view, you can change the date using gestures or a datepicker to query the database

Since it's my first public attempt, I will try to make it perfect

I have to thank [Petros](https://github.com/petros) and [Vassilis](https://github.com/damphyr) for guiding me and [Panagiotis](https://github.com/konstantinos2012) for introducing them.
